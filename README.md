# TheOdinProject-LandingPage
[1/2] Projects from Foundations course by TheOdinProject

This project will feature what I have learned throughout the Foundations course by TheOdinProject.
Mainly focused on HTML and basic CSS.

As I was writing this HTML I had the bright idea to insert some creative and interactive elements. But, as I researched further into how to add them, I would need some JavaScript knowledge.
So, I could learn some JS and then get back into this portion, but it wouldn't be fair to this project, since it's supposed to showcase what I have learned so far into this course (BEFORE getting into JS). That's why I decided to shut down the designer inside me and work only with what I have learned so far.

Final thoughts: I was going to create the entire website, but since this was only supposed to be a landing page - and I want to get creative on my final portfolio - I added a working dog to help me with extra pages. I'm happy with the overall results and proud of what I've learned.

I have used tilt.js (https://gijsroge.github.io/tilt.js/) for the tilt mechanic seen on index.html
