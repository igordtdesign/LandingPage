        <h2>Brazil, 1998</h2>
        <p>I was born in a small town, in southern Brazil. There I was introduced to art by my mother, an art teacher at my school.</p>
        <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> I did not want to be a Graphic Designer when I was a kid. In fact, I dreamed of becoming a Formula 1 driver... <em>and as you might have thought, it did not work out</em></p>
        <p>Initially, my academic career began in IT, studying Information Systems. Although I still really liked to study tech-related subjects, I switched majors to Communications, where I graduated. With all my years of experience in Graphic Design, I still really liked technology, so I enrolled in a postgraduate course in UX Design. 
I am a person who is interested in several areas and I like to delve deeper into each of them. In my work, I am meticulous and I like to achieve excellence in what I set out to do. Due to my dedication, I have been awarded 4 times for my work.</p>
        <p>Also, I am always trying to improve and learn new things. Apart from my postgraduate degree, I also learned coding for fun. This entire website was done by me with only a couple months of studying.</p>
        <p><strong>Another fun fact:</strong> the entire color palette from this website is based on the flag of my home state, Rio Grande do Sul.</p>
